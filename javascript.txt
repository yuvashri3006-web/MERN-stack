Basic JavaScript Assessment 
Section 1 — Variables & Assignment 
1. Declare three variables to store: 
○ Your name (string) 
○ Your age (number) 
○ Whether you are a student (boolean) 
2. Assign values to those variables and print them to the console. 
3. Create two variables a and b with numeric values. 
Swap their values without using a third variable. 
4. What will be printed and why? 
let x = 10; 
let y = x; 
y = 20; 
console.log(x); 
5. Rewrite this using const where appropriate: 
var pi = 3.14; 
var radius = 5; 
var area = pi * radius * radius; 
Section 2 — Operators 
6. Write code that takes two numbers and prints: 
○ Sum 
○ Difference 
○ Product 
○ Quotient 
○ Remainder 
7. Predict the output: 
console.log(5 + "5"); 
console.log(5 - "2"); 
console.log(true + 1); 
8. Write a program that checks whether a number is: 
○ Greater than 100 
○ Equal to 100 
○ Less than 100 
(Use comparison operators) 
9. Explain the difference by testing: 
5 == "5" 
5 === "5" 
10. Use logical operators to check: 
● Age between 18 and 60 (inclusive) 
● Print eligible/not eligible 
Section 3 — Control Statements 
11. Write an if-else program that: 
● Checks if a number is even or odd 
12. Extend the above: 
● If number divisible by 3 → print "Fizz" 
● If divisible by 5 → print "Buzz" 
● If both → "FizzBuzz" 
13. Use switch: 
● Input a number (1–7) 
● Output corresponding weekday 
14. Write a for loop that: 
● Prints numbers 1–20 
● Prints only even numbers 
15. Write a while loop to: 
● Calculate sum of numbers from 1 to N 
16. Use break and continue: 
● Print numbers 1–10 
● Skip 5 
● Stop entirely at 8 
Section 4 — Functions 
17. Write a function that: 
● Accepts two numbers 
● Returns their sum 
18. Convert the above into: 
● Arrow function syntax 
19. Write a function to: 
● Check if a number is prime 
20. Write a function that: 
● Accepts a string 
● Returns it reversed 
21. What is the output? 
function test() { 
return; 
console.log("Hello"); 
} 
test(); 
22. Create a function that: 
● Takes an array of numbers 
● Returns the largest number 
Section 5 — Integrated Challenge (Covers Everything) 
23. Build a program that: 
● Accepts student marks 
● Uses a function to calculate grade: 
○ 90+ → A 
○ 75–89 → B 
○ 50–74 → C 
○ <50 → Fail 
● Uses control statements 
● Uses operators 
● Stores result in variables
● Prints final output
