You must create a single HTML file named portfolio.html that serves as your personal portfolio website.
You are allowed to use HTML tags only — no CSS and no JavaScript.
Your portfolio must include all of the following elements and features:
1. A proper HTML5 document structure with correct DOCTYPE and language attribute.
2. A meaningful page <title>.
3. Your full name displayed as the main heading of the page.
4. At least one paragraph introducing yourself.
5. Use of bold, italic, underlined, strikethrough, superscript, subscript, and inline code formatting somewhere in the text.
6. An ordered list (<ol>) and an unordered list (<ul>) showing two different kinds of information (e.g. skills, hobbies, subjects, etc.).
7. Internal navigation links that jump to different sections of the same page.
8. At least one self-contained <article> block describing something about you (e.g. bio, goal, experience).
9. At least one <details> + <summary> element that reveals extra information when clicked.
10. At least two <figure> elements, each containing:
   * An <img> with proper alt text OR
   * A <video> with controls OR
   * An <audio> with controls …and each figure must have a <figcaption>.
11. A <progress> bar showing your skill level or completion percentage for at least three different skills.
12. A <table> that displays your academic marks / grades containing at least:
   * A caption
   * Table header row (<th>)
   * At least 4 rows of data
   * Columns for subject, marks, and grade (or similar)
13. A contact form that contains all of the following input types:
   * Text input (for name)
   * Email input
   * Radio buttons (at least 2 options, e.g. gender)
   * Checkboxes (at least 3 options, e.g. interests/hobbies)
   * A <select> dropdown list with at least 3 options (e.g. country, preferred contact method, etc.)
   * A submit button
   * Each input/control must be correctly associated with a <label>
14. A footer section containing a copyright notice with the current year.
Additional rules:
* Every major section of the page should have a suitable heading level (<h1> to <h6>).
* Use semantic HTML tags wherever they make sense (header, nav, section, footer, etc.).
* The page must remain readable and logically structured even without any styling.
* All media (images, video, audio) must include proper fallback text for browsers that cannot display them.
