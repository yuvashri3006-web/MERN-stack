CSS Portfolio Assignment – Show All These Features in One File 
Create a single HTML file with internal <style> (no separate .css file) that represents your 
personal portfolio page. 
Must include these sections (at minimum): 
● Navigation bar (sticky) 
● Hero section with heading + button(s) 
● Projects section with at least 4 project cards (each with image + title + short 
description) 
● About section with some text paragraphs 
● Optional: Contact or Footer 
Mandatory CSS Requirements – You must use ALL of the following concepts visibly 
and meaningfully: 
★ Every kind of selector 
○ Element selector (body, h1, p, etc.) 
○ Class selector (.card, .btn, etc.) 
○ ID selector (#hero, #projects, etc.) 
○ All combinators: 
■ Descendant (space) 
■ Child (>) 
★ Pseudo-classes (must be used and noticeable) 
○ :hover 
○ :focus 
○ :active 
○ :nth-child()  
★ Pseudo-elements 
○ ::before 
○ ::after 
○ ::first-letter 
★ Show selector priority / specificity 
○ Write rules with different specificity levels and make it visible which one wins 
(you can use colors or borders to prove it) 
○ Bonus: use !important once (only for teaching purpose) and comment why 
★ Box model in action 
○ Create cards and buttons using: 
■ padding, margin, border, border-radius 
■ outline (especially visible on :focus or :hover) 
★ Overflow – show all four values clearly 
○ Create 4 small boxes with long text inside and apply: 
■ overflow: visible 
■ overflow: hidden 
■ overflow: scroll 
■ overflow: auto 
★ Google Fonts 
○ Import at least two Google Fonts (one for headings, one for body) 
○ Use them properly 
★ Typography controls 
○ letter-spacing 
○ word-spacing 
○ line-height 
○ text-align 
○ text-decoration (different kinds) 
○ text-transform 
○ text-shadow 
★ Display types – use all three meaningfully 
○ display: block 
○ display: inline 
○ display: inline-block 
★ Positioning – use all four types 
○ position: static (default – mention it) 
○ position: relative (small offset or layering) 
○ position: fixed (e.g. back-to-top button) 
○ position: sticky (e.g. navigation bar) 
★ Flexbox – must be used in two places 
○ One place: 4 project images/cards in a row (use flex, justify-content, gap) 
○ Second place: Navigation bar (use flex, align-items, justify-content) 
○ Change flex-direction from row to column on mobile screens using media 
query 
★ Media query 
○ At least one @media rule (max-width: 768px or similar) 
○ Change layout (especially flex-direction of nav and/or gallery) 
Extra good-to-have (but not mandatory): 
● Hover lift / scale effect on cards & buttons 
● Smooth transition 
● Nice color scheme 
● Responsive images (object-fit, etc.) 
● Comments in CSS explaining which concept is being shown where 
Submission rules: 
● One single .html file (everything inside <style>) 
● Use placeholder images (via https://via.placeholder.com or unsplash links) 
● Make it look clean and modern — don’t just make ugly boxes 
Good luck!
